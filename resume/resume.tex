            I'm general purpose programmer who has worked on building, maintaining, and scaling web applications. I work primarily in Python, but have no strong language preference and have used C, C\#, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Javascript.  I have experience with larger IDEs, such as Visual Studio, MonoDevelop, and XCode, but claim no great proficiencies. \\
            \par
            I have worked with teams in an agile style to quickly deliver features and products. I have worked with ticketing systems, such as Jira and Trello, to manage work loads. I have worked with source control systems, like Subversion and Git. I have experience with Test Driven Development through the use of unit tests. \\
            \par
            I have contributed some code to open source projects Bottle, watchwithme, and pyrollbar.\\
